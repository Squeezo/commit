# Commit - Tech News for Activists Coders

This is the source code behind https://commit.ws/.

Actually, to boostrap the site, we're using https://github.com/antirez/lamernews

Everything under `v0-lamernews` are changes which should be copied directly over a properly working `lamernews` deployment.

See `INSTALL.md` for details.
